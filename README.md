# First Project for Introduction to data structures


This is an introductory exercise for beginners in the topics of data structures. In this project you use structures and arrays to create a very simple program.


## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites


What things you need to install the software and how to install them


First of all you need to have minGW or any distribution of GCC that allows you to write and compile in C++.


In the link below you could find a minGW manager for the collection of compilers GCC:

```
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
```


### Installing


After you download the wizard for minGW you just need to follow the steps in the wizard, remember where do you let the files.
In case that you had an error for the path variables, just go to the environment variables, in the PATH add the location of your minGW compiler.


If you installed the compiler correctly you could use the next code


```
gcc -v
```

That deploys a list of features about the version that you have installed.


Also you will need a IDE, I recommend you used VS Code


## Running the tests


Once you had the clone in your computer you will need to use the following command in your terminal to create a .EXE

Make sure you arre inside the clone file.

```
g++ -o main main.cpp

```

Then execute the main.exe file in the terminal.


## Deployment


You could save this file as a .BAT file to execute the program.< every time you wanted.


## Built With


* [CPP](hhttps://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference?view=msvc-170) - Web documentation to use C++.
